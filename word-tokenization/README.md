# WiseSight Samples with Word Tokenization Label

This directory contains WiseSight samples by tokenized humans. These samples are randomly drawn from the corpus, with 40 samples for each label. 

Because these samples are representative of real word content, we believe having these annotaed samples will allow the community to robustly evaluate tokenization algorithms.
